# Shadertoyeditor
OpenGL Shadereditor for Purebasic

With these opengl Shadertoyeditor it is possible to use shader form the webside www.shadertoy.com with the programming language Purebasic. The Programm works with Windows, MAC OS X, Linux (included RaspBeery PI)

IMPORTANT
I show some example shader from the www.shadertoy.com website. For the shaders available here in the demo directory, the rights that the creator has given to the shader apply. If I have used a shader that is not freely available, I apologise and will remove it immediately. These are only learning examples, also to animate new programmers to create new shader.

All shader with the name ..PI4000.txt was tested with a Raspbeery PI4000 with Raspberry Pi OS
